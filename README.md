# Minimum Enclosing Ball for Anomaly Detection on Biological Data using Frank-Wolfe based algorithms

The Minimum Enclosing Ball (MEB) is a problem with a wide range of applications, of which anomaly detection is a prominent one. In this project, our goal is to understand and implement the MEB problem through three different variants of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm: the Pairwise Frank-Wolfe, the Blended Pairwise Conditional Gradient and an adaptation using Away-Steps. 

We have chosen four different biological datasets: 

- a Breast cancer dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic);
- a Breast cancer gene expression dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/401/gene+expression+cancer+rna+seq);
- a Vertebral column pathology dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/212/vertebral+column); and
- a Maternity risk dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/863/maternal+health+risk).

It's for each of this data and context that we look to identify anomalies, which in the medical field and regarding patients, usually represents some sort of health problem.
